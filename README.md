### Hey there! I'm Alexander West👋

🎓 I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at **UCLA**, with an expected graduation in June 2025.  <br />
🛠️ I was a Software Engineering Intern at **Code On Time LLC**

📚 My academic journey at UCLA has immersed me in topics ranging from **Algorithms**, **Data Structures**, and **Operating System Principles** to emerging fields like **Distributed Algorithms and Blockchains**. My participation in **Psi Beta Rho** further exposed me to the world of cybersecurity, where I've tackled challenges from events like SquareCTF and EKOParty CTF.

🔭 Through my GitHub repositories, you'll witness my journey and the hands-on experience I've garnered over the years. I hope they provide insight into my dedication, curiosity, and the consistent effort I invest in learning and growing.

### Beyond Computer Science
🏄 I love surfing in San Diego and Malibu <br />
🏕️ I'm passionate about camping and backpacking (esp northern California and the Sierras) <br />
🤿 I scuba and free dive around the world <br />
🍳 I like cooking thai food <br />
